# Deploying-Wazuh-SIEM
Setting up an AlmaLinux VM on VMware Workstation and deploying Wazuh SIEM, using a Windows 11 Pro PC.

## üéØ Objective
This project focuses on deploying a **Wazuh SIEM Manager** on an **AlmaLinux** virtual machine (VM) using **VMware Workstation 17**. The goal is to establish a functional **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system for security monitoring and log analysis.

### What is Wazuh?
**Wazuh** is a free, open-source **SIEM and XDR (Extended Detection and Response) platform** that provides threat detection, security monitoring, and compliance enforcement. It is widely used by security professionals to analyze logs, detect anomalies, and respond to security incidents in real-time. Wazuh supports **multi-platform agents** and integrates with various security tools, making it a powerful solution for cybersecurity operations without licensing costs.

## üìù Note: Real-World Deployments  

While this project focuses on setting up Wazuh SIEM on a **VMware Workstation 17** virtual machine for a personal lab environment, cybersecurity professionals in enterprise settings work with a variety of deployment infrastructures, including:  

- **On-Premises Data Centers** ‚Äì Physical servers running hypervisors like **VMware ESXi**, **Proxmox**, or **Hyper-V** to host critical security applications.  
- **Cloud-Based Deployments** ‚Äì Organizations often deploy SIEM solutions in **Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud**, using virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, or managed SIEM services.  
- **Hybrid Environments** ‚Äì Many companies integrate **on-premise SIEM servers** with **cloud-based security tools** for centralized log management and incident response.  
- **Enterprise-Grade Hardware** ‚Äì Cybersecurity teams may work with **dedicated security appliances** (**Cisco, Palo Alto, Fortinet** firewalls) and high-performance storage for log retention.  

Understanding virtualization in **VMware Workstation** is a great starting point, but professionals often transition to handling enterprise-scale deployments across complex infrastructures.

By following this guide, you will learn:
- How to **download and install** AlmaLinux Minimal ISO.
- How to **create and configure** an AlmaLinux VM in VMware Workstation.
- How to **deploy and install** the Wazuh Manager components.
- How to **access and navigate** the Wazuh web UI for security event monitoring.

## üìö Skills Learned
